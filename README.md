# Why is DSA important and where is it useful in real-time applications? ðŸš€

- Way to structure the data â†’ retrieval, store, process, organize.
- Array, Linked List, Tree, Stack, Queue, Graph and many more.
- List of records â†’ Insertion, Deletion and Searching.
- Applications of Data Structures in real life:
    - Search is the most Frequent Operation â†’ arrays (binary search).
    - Insertion and deletion are the most frequent operations â†’ Linked list.
    - Undo: Ctrl + Z â†’ LIFO (Last In First Out) â†’ Stack.
    - Spotify:  Linked List.
    - Uber, Ola: Graph.
    - E-commerce website: Tree.
    - Browser data history: FIFO â†’ Queue.
